# LxApi

This repository acts as the backend for [Lx](https://github.com/BattleMage0231/LxFrontend).

To run this project locally in development mode, populate the MongoDB ConnectionURI and DatabaseName in `appsettings.json` and run `dotnet run`. The API should then be live at http://localhost:5163
